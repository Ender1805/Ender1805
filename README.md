Hi, Iâ€™m @Ender1805. I'm mostly an amateur programmer that uses a bunch of languages: C#, Python3, Golang, C, Lua, HTML...

I use Github here to simply host my programming projects. My personal repositories will be private, and i'll be the only one to work on them. 
I might eventually take part of an open source project or create an open source repository in the future, but it's really not planned.

Please only send me a message if it's related to open source projects i work on. I won't answer anything that isn't related to that.
