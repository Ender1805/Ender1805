Hi, I'm @Ender1805. I like to program things.

I started programming out of curiosity and never stopped since. I mainly use C# for my current projects, but I also learn C, C++ and some basic Python to pursue my learning.

I use GitHub to host my programming projects. These will be kept private unless I decide to make them FOSS. I mainly program simple utilities, some libraries and quite a few game prototypes.

Please only send private messages if it's related to a project we're working on. Don't try to contact me for anything else.
