Hi, Iâ€™m @Ender1805. I'm mostly an amateur programmer that uses a bunch of languages...

I use Github here to simply host my programming projects. My personal repositories will be private, and i'll be the only one to work on them. 
I might eventually take part of an open source project or create an open source repository in the future, but it's really not planned.

I tend to create simple but usable programs. My goal is to master at least the basics of languages i find interesting.

Here's a list of the languages i use:
- C#
- Python
- C
- Golang
- Lua
- HTML
- CSS
- Kotlin

Please only send me a message if it's related to open source projects i work on. I won't answer anything that isn't related to that.
